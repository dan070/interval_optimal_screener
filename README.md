# interval_optimal_screener
Screening for predictive modeling optimal buckets for a variable

This is a Shiny project, runnable in R-studio. 
Purpose is to let user upload some data-file, choose a target variable for predctive modeling, then a continuous variable that we want to find the best sub-interval for. 
The program lets user (calculate and) visualise ALL imaginable intervals. This can take some time to calculate.
